Some lives leave behind achievements. The greatest leave behind a vision.
Alberto Vignatelli was a visionary entrepreneur who understood luxury as culture, responsibility, and lifestyle — long before it became a global language.
“The Invention of Luxury. Lifestyle according to Alberto Vignatelli”, edited by Olga Vignatelli and published by Rizzoli, is an intimate and professional tribute to an entrepreneurial and human legacy that reshaped the meaning of contemporary luxury. More than a biography, the book explores a way of thinking, creating, and living luxury — a philosophy that continues to define the vision and identity of Luxury Living Group.
A story of vision, passion and timeless elegance.
