Above the city, the sky became a stage for Ciel Dubai Marina.
 
The world’s tallest hotel revealed itself as a vertical arena, where every level brings a new perspective and every moment feels infinite. From the clouds, @xdubai wingsuit athletes flew through the “Eye of the Needle” at speeds exceeding 200 km/h.
 
In partnership with @visit.dubai and @skydivedubai , the event unfolded - a story written in the sky, every moment a testament to a daring vision.
 
As part of @vignettehotels ,Ciel brings together individuality and ambition, crafted to deliver one-of-a-kind experiences. A milestone for @thefirstgroup , setting a new benchmark for hospitality in the UAE.
